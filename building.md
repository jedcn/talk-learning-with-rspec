# Build Instructions for: Learning with RSpec

The tool used the build these slides is called
[reveal-ck](https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck), and it's a tool based
in Ruby.

That said, the following instructions will seem standard to you if
you've done a bunch of Ruby, and bizarre if you haven't.

Please get in touch if you'd like to figure this out and are having
trouble.

## Steps for building the slides

After cloning this project, and cd'ing into the cloned directory:

* ```bundle```
* ```reveal-ck generate```

Slides will be created in the ```slides/``` directory.

The entry point for the slides is ```slides/index.html```.
