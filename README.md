# Talk: Learning With RSpec

## Overview

These are the notes and the slides for a talk that I gave titled
**Learning with RSpec.**

The general idea behind the talk can be found here:
[talk.md](https://github.com/jedcn/talk-learning-with-rspec/blob/master/talk.md)

The basis for the slide content can be found here:
[slides.haml](https://github.com/jedcn/talk-learning-with-rspec/blob/master/slides.haml).

## Viewing

The slides are available here:

## Miscellaneous

This project uses a tool named
[reveal-ck](https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck) to transform the
contents of ```slides.haml``` into HTML slides.

The final presentation of the slides happens in a framework named
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

[reveal-ck](https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck) is a 'reveal.js
construction kit.'

If you'd like to build the slides for yourself, you can see
